19/12/2025 - Completing the framework
- [x] Back testing and optimisation frameworks have been completed it the Alpha Strategy implemented.
- [x] Include a more robust portfolio of securities and detail their categorisation in the documentation for the framework.
- [x] Run a basic portfolio optimisation (with default capital contention algorithm) to gage the favourable parameters to use.
	- Select only a handful of securities to prevent major computation time but make sure the selection is representative of the market and only focus on large and mega cap securities.

20/12/2025
- [x] Run single security back tests for the large-mega cap securities using the optimised parameters.
- [x] Utilise the above trade logs to find the ideal vulnerability score settings and perform a portfolio back test using these settings.
23/12/2025
- [x] Create a portfolio of a mix of securities that will be used to analyse based on fundamental information.
- [x] Comparing trade frequency between optimised and base parameters to decide which is more useful.
- [ ] Perform single security back tests and try to understand in what market conditions are these securities performing and not performing.


***The main idea for now is to find a base performance of this strategy find out what it is lacking, where it performs best and where it performs at it's worst.***
