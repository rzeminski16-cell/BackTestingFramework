19/12/2025 - Completing the framework
- [x] Back testing and optimisation frameworks have been completed it the Alpha Strategy implemented.
- [x] Include a more robust portfolio of securities and detail their categorisation in the documentation for the framework.
- [x] Run a basic portfolio optimisation (with default capital contention algorithm) to gage the favourable parameters to use.
	- Select only a handful of securities to prevent major computation time but make sure the selection is representative of the market and only focus on large and mega cap securities.

20/12/2025
- [ ] Run single security back tests for the large-mega cap securities using the optimised parameters.
- [ ] Utilise the above trade logs to find the ideal vulnerability score settings and perform a portfolio back test using these settings.

***The main idea for now is to find a base performance of this strategy find out what it is lacking, where it performs best and where it performs at it's worst.***
