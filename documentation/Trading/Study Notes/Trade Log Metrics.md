## Risk metrics

- **Volatility (annualized) %**
    - Definition: Annualized standard deviation of returns; measures total variability (up and down).
	![[Pasted image 20251226101853.png]]
- **Downside deviation %**
    - Definition: Annualized standard deviation of only negative (below target, often 0 or risk‑free) returns.
    - Formula (conceptual): Take only returns << target, compute their standard deviation, then annualize as with volatility.

## Behaviour / consistency metrics

- **Strategy exposure %**

- **Monthly consistency (std dev %)**
    - Definition: Standard deviation of monthly returns; lower values mean more consistent month‑to‑month performance.
    - Formula: Compute standard deviation of monthly returns, optionally express as a percentage of average monthly return.
