CAPITAL CONTENTION SUMMARY
----------------------------------------
  Capital contention events: 0
  Buy signals skipped due to insufficient capital: 0

----------------------------------------
VULNERABILITY SCORE SNAPSHOTS
----------------------------------------
  No vulnerability score snapshots recorded.
  (This likely means no capital contention occurred)

----------------------------------------
SWAP EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------
No swaps were made during the backtest period.

================================================================================
DETAILED VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS
================================================================================
VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------

NO CAPITAL CONTENTION DETECTED

Possible reasons:
  1. Positions do not overlap in time (trades are sequential)
  2. Sufficient capital to hold all positions simultaneously
  3. Position sizing is small relative to capital

However, 455 trade overlaps were found in single-security tests.
This means trades WOULD have overlapped with unlimited capital,
but the portfolio's capital constraints meant only one position
was open at a time (no contention needed).

Explanation:
  - In single-security tests, each security has its own $100k capital
  - In portfolio mode, all securities share $100k total
  - With limited capital, trades are taken sequentially
  - The first signal wins, blocking others until capital is freed

----------------------------------------

CAPITAL ALLOCATION EVENTS SUMMARY

  Total capital events: 113
  Signals executed: 113
  Signals rejected: 0
  Positions swapped in: 0
  Positions swapped out: 0

----------------------------------------

WHAT 'SIGNAL REJECTIONS' MEANS:
  A signal rejection occurs when a buy signal is generated
  but the portfolio cannot execute it due to:
    - Insufficient available capital
    - Existing positions blocking capital
    - Vulnerability score too high to swap existing position

WHAT 'TRADE OVERLAPS' MEANS:
  Trade overlaps show periods when trades from different
  securities would have been open simultaneously if each
  had unlimited capital. This indicates potential capital
  contention points in a shared-capital portfolio.
