CAPITAL ALLOCATION EVENTS SUMMARY

  Total capital events: 341
  Signals executed: 336
  Signals rejected: 3
  Positions swapped in: 1
  Positions swapped out: 1

  Sample events with vulnerability scores:
    2007-01-10 [EXECUTED] AAPL: BK: 50.0, MS: 0.0
      -> Executed (sufficient capital)
    2007-01-10 [EXECUTED] BLK: BK: 50.0, MS: 0.0
      -> Executed (sufficient capital)
    2010-03-10 [EXECUTED] AAPL: BK: 100.0, BLK: 40.0
      -> Executed (sufficient capital)
    2010-03-10 [EXECUTED] MS: BK: 100.0, BLK: 40.0
      -> Executed (sufficient capital)
    2010-11-05 [EXECUTED] BK: AAPL: 44.0
      -> Executed (sufficient capital)

----------------------------------------

WHAT 'SIGNAL REJECTIONS' MEANS:
  A signal rejection occurs when a buy signal is generated
  but the portfolio cannot execute it due to:
    - Insufficient available capital
    - Existing positions blocking capital
    - Vulnerability score too high to swap existing position

WHAT 'TRADE OVERLAPS' MEANS:
  Trade overlaps show periods when trades from different
  securities would have been open simultaneously if each
  had unlimited capital. This indicates potential capital
  contention points in a shared-capital portfolio.
