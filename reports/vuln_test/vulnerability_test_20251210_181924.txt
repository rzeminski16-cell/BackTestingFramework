CAPITAL ALLOCATION EVENTS SUMMARY

  Total capital events: 362
  Signals executed: 325
  Signals rejected: 13
  Positions swapped in: 12
  Positions swapped out: 12

  Sample events with vulnerability scores:
    2003-05-02 [EXECUTED] AAPL: BK: 62.0, BLK: 75.0, MS: 62.0
      -> Executed at 93% position size
    2004-01-05 [EXECUTED] AAPL: BK: 73.0, MS: 30.0
      -> Executed at 92% position size
    2004-01-08 [REJECTED] BLK: BK: 70.0, MS: 83.0
      -> Rejected: No vulnerable positions (weakest: BK with score 70.0 >= threshold 50.0)
    2004-02-19 [EXECUTED] MS: BK: 100.0, BLK: 100.0
      -> Executed at 63% position size
    2005-06-23 [EXECUTED] AAPL: BK: 0.0, MS: 100.0
      -> Executed at 76% position size

----------------------------------------

WHAT 'SIGNAL REJECTIONS' MEANS:
  A signal rejection occurs when a buy signal is generated
  but the portfolio cannot execute it due to:
    - Insufficient available capital
    - Existing positions blocking capital
    - Vulnerability score too high to swap existing position

WHAT 'TRADE OVERLAPS' MEANS:
  Trade overlaps show periods when trades from different
  securities would have been open simultaneously if each
  had unlimited capital. This indicates potential capital
  contention points in a shared-capital portfolio.
